Project Description: The main background of this project is an introduction to the use of Git and Github to make use of Code Version Control in future code projects. The purpose of this project is to become familiar
with the use of Git Version control to keep track of code changes in future coding projects.

Install Instructions
- The first step in the installation process is to first create an account on Github as this will be crucial to using Git and Github to access code version control
- The next step in the installation process is to install Git as that well be crucial to code version control in Github
- Once the Github and Git setup process is complete, install an IDE editor suitable for the project (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

Run Instructions
 - To create a new repository, click the "Create a new repository" button on the home page of Github to create a new repository and give it a title appropriate to the project
 - To clone the repository, open the Command Type Application and type git clone with the repository link next to it before pressing enter. The repository will be cloned afterwards
 - If the repository is going to be turned into a node project, on the command application, type npm init with the repository link next to it before pressing enter to turn the repository into a new project
 - In order to create a new file that prints out "Hello World", under the repository title, click the icon where it shows users the ability to create a new file and title it as index.js. Upon creating the index.js file, type "console.log("Hello World")" using the console.log function and create a new terminal with "node index.js" being typed in it to print out the "Hello World" phrase.
 - To add changes being made to the repository, in the terminal command, type git add; press enter and then type git commit -am "initial commit" with the repository link next to it to successfully add the changes made to the repository
- To update the git repository at Github using the local file repository that's been cloned, open the terminal prompt on Visual Studio Code (or equivalent in another IDE editor) and type the command "git push origin main" to successfully update the repository.
